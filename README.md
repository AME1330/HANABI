In some systems, data needs to be input one key at a time. This program provides a solution to combine isolated values into a complete formula. The input and display of keys are currently presented in the form of a console on a general-purpose computer.

This calculator program can perform basic arithmetic operations (up to 15 additions and 5 multiplications in a time) and has a delete/backspace function. More features are still being explored.

I am a beginner in programming, and this is my first attempt at coding. There are still many shortcomings, so I would appreciate your guidance. Since I am not a native English speaker, the English content is machine-translated. Please understand if there are any inaccuracies in the expression.
